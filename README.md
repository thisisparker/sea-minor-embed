# Sea Minor

This is a ~forked~ duplicated snapshot of the working [Sea Minor](https://github.com/thisisparker/sea-minor) repo, built to embed into [a blog post about generating an infinite sea shanty in the browser](https://parkerhiggins.net/2025/06/generating-infinite-sea-shanty-in-the-browser/).

I also wrote a bit about why this is a duplicated repo [and not a fork](https://parkerhiggins.net/2025/06/you-cant-fork-your-own-github-repo/).
